# Mini Civ 5

ðŸ“Œ [See my other Civ projects here](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Abmaupin+topic%3Acivilization&type=Repositories)

This is a mod to Sid Meier's Civilization V to allow much shorter games. Features include:

- **Very** small maps (hence the name)
- New game options to allow for faster play
- Compatible with the base game, Gods and Kings, and Brave New World

See [below](#features) for more information.

## Installation

The mod hasn't yet been published to Steam as it's still undergoing testing. You may install it manually if you wish (see below)

## Usage

1. Start Civ 5 and go to the _Mods_ menu
1. Check _Mini Civ 5_ and then start a new game

## Features

- Smaller maps: this alone has the biggest impact on the length of the game
- Shows hidden game options: this allows disabling of some game features (religion, happiness, etc.) that could make the game quicker
- Disables buildings and wonders related to hidden game options. For example, if religion is disabled then the shrine building and the Grand Temple wonder will not show in the city's build queue.
- New game options:
  - Scouts Start Automated
  - Workers Start Automated

## Known issues

The map sizes in this mod are so small that they may negatively impact gameplay. Testing of the map sizes is ongoing.

## Wishlist

- [ ] Publish to Steam
  - Once the mod has been more thoroughly tested
- [ ] Adjust map sizes?
  - Needs more testing
- [ ] Limit number of settlers?
  - An alternative to extremely small map sizes could be limiting the number of settlers per player, for example disable building new settlers after the player has N cities (e.g. 3). This could allow bigger map sizes for less of a negative impact on gameplay.
- [ ] Disable units from previous eras?
  - E.g. if a cannon replaces an archer, archer should not longer be available to build
  - Maybe the game already does this?
- [ ] Options to disable additional expansion content
  - Each expansion added more buildings, units, wonders, etc., all of which can increase the length of the game. It might be nice to have one or more options to disable these additions to allow the game to be played with the mechanics or additional civs of an expansion but without the additional content.
