## Getting WorldBuilder running in Linux

#### Current progress

Currently gets to the WorldBuilder menu but crashes when clicking _New Map_ with this error:

```
X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  12 (X_ConfigureWindow)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x9400a35
  Serial number of failed request:  2845
  Current serial number in output stream:  2845
```

1. Start the Civ 5 SDK at least once to create the Wine prefix

1. Run Civ 5 using Proton (instead of Native)

   ðŸ‘‰ TODO: is this needed?

1. Set Civ 5 launch options

   ```
   %command% \\dx9 -Nexus 4320`
   ```

1. Start Civ 5

1. Set Civ 5 SDK launch options

   ðŸ‘‰ TODO: is this needed?

   ```
   /home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/reaper SteamLaunch AppId=16830 -- /home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-launch-wrapper -- "/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper"/_v2-entry-point --verb=waitforexitandrun -- "/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton 8.0"/proton waitforexitandrun  "/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization V SDK/WorldBuilder/x86/WorldBuilder.exe" -PromptForGamePath # %command%
   ```

1. Start Civ 5 SDK

1. When prompted, browse to Civ 5 exe, e.g.

   ðŸ‘‰ TODO: is this needed?

   ```
   z:\home\user\.steam\steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\CivilizationV.exe
   ```

   - Replace `user` with your username

1. Wait until connection is established between SDK and Civ 5, e.g.

   ```
   $ netstat -antlp | grep 4320
   tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:4320          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      439482/wineserver
   tcp     6450      0 127.0.0.1:4320          127.0.0.1:32944         ESTABLISHED 439482/wineserver
   tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:32944         127.0.0.1:4320          ESTABLISHED 433820/wineserver
   ```

1. Stop Civ 5

   - Ignore the SDK message

1. Start Civ 5 again, and the WorldBuilder menu should show

#### To do

- [ ] Confirm that the BadWindow error only happens when the game crashes
- [ ] Try installing .NET 3.5

  - [ ] Try installing from Steam depot

    ```
    STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH="/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/16830" STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH="/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam" "/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton 8.0"/proton waitforexitandrun  ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Steamworks\ Shared/_CommonRedist/DotNet/3.5/dotnetfx35.exe
    ```

  - [ ] Try installing using protontricks

    ```

    protontricks 16830 -q dotnet35
    ```

- [ ] Try launching WorldBuilder with `-PromptForGamePath`?

  - (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/if-youre-having-problems-launching-worldbuilder.490200/)

  - `z:\home\user\.steam\steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\CivilizationV.exe`

- [x] Try launching Civ 5 manually: `%command% \\dx9 -Nexus 4320`
- [ ] Try launching WorldBuilder with wine/proton outside of Steam?

#### Notes

- WorldBuilder needs .NET 3.5

- WorldBuilder starts Civ 5 with this parameter: `-Nexus 4320`
  - Maybe this is some kind of socket connection so WorldBuilder can connect to Civ 5?
  - Does WorldBuilder also need access to
