# Religion

Vanilla Civ 5 does not have religion. Espionage was added in the Gods and Kings expansion.

Religion in Civ 5 could be disabled simply by disabling the Gods and Kings DLC, but then this disables all other features of the DLC. It seems like it might be desirable to have the ability to disable religion while still allowing the Gods and Kings DLC.

Civ 5 seems to already have a game option (`GAMEOPTION_NO_RELIGION`) for disabling religion, but it's marked as hidden in the game configuration (`CIV5GameOptions_Inherited_Expansion2.xml`).

It seems like it would be ideal if we could simply enable that option to allow users the choice of whether or not to disable religion.
