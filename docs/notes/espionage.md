# Espionage

Vanilla Civ 5 does not have espionage. Espionage was added in the Gods and Kings expansion.

Like Civ 4, Civ 5 has an option when starting a new game to disable espionage. In Civ 4, when espionage is disabled, all espionage points are converted to culture points; this is specifically mentioned in the tooltip for the option. But this could affect the balance of the game as players (including AI players) could try to use this to win a culture victory (more information [here](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/end-of-espionage.340293/)).

In Civ 5, however, there are no espionage points, and there is no mention in the tooltip of the _No Espionage_ game option that there are any secondary effects. So disabling espionage in the game options should be sufficient, and for now it seems best to leave espionage unmodified.
